**SNAKE GAME (OOP VERSION)**

This is a modernized and fully object-oriented version of the classic Snake game developed with **Python** and **Pygame**. It features multiple game modes, a functioning leaderboard, sound effects, and a clean graphical interface. This project originally started as a procedural Snake game example from PythonGeeks.org. I used that as a reference and completely redesigned the codebase using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to meet the requirements for our final course project.

**GAME FEATURES**

**Three Playable Modes**  
  - **Normal Mode** – Classic snake experience  
  - **Blitz Mode** – 30-second challenge mode  
  - **Inverted Mode** – Controls are reversed for added difficulty
  - **Leaderboard System** (per game mode)  
  - **High Score Prompt** (enter your name if you beat the current high score)
